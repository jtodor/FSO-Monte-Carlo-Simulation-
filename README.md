# FSO-Monte-Carlo-Simulation-
Is there a code for Monte Carlo simulation of the Bit Error Rate of FSO channel in the presence of different levels of turbulence and in the case of pointing error? Is it possible to apply the code to different channel models (Gamma-Gamma, Rician, Raylegh, Log-normal, ...)?
